Programmer notes for contraption.

The model is a strict input/output model.  The user defines the source
of inputs, and which output products they want.  Then we glue it all
together and run it.

Sources have default names and the user may define a default
directory.  These can all be overridden.

But developing everything monolithicly feels like a mess.  So I'm
going to develop multiple executables, then merge them after they're
done.

Did token and syntax, for the datatypes.  Next step seems to require
involving the CSV, doesn't it?  The Env wants access to overrides; the
overrides *don't* live in Config but are loaded from the CSV.

----
 * What do I need to do for prettyprinting inputs?  Don't lose that.
 * I'm not distinguishing between no exports and no export-list.
 * I probably want to insert "full" into "module name" in Env.
